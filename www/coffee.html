                <h2>METROPOLIS OF COFFEE</h2>
                <img src="img/coffee_main.png">
                <h3>Coffee arrived with the Dutch and took firmer hold with each successive century</h3>
                <p>By Christina Chisholm<br><br>Donald Schoenholt’s history with coffee began with slices of marmalade toast. As a child, he was plucked up every Sunday by his sizable family and carried with them to his grandmother’s house. It was there, in a quiet, residential neighborhood in Queens, that the smell of percolating coffee married the sound of a knife sliding marmalade onto crinkly rye bread. Sixty-four years later, brewed Sunday coffee still summons the crunch of toast, the swishing of hands brushing crumbs off the Times—“which in case you’re young enough to know,” he says, “was a full column wider than it is now.”<br><br>In truth, even though this is Schoenholt’s earliest memory of his relationship with coffee, the drink must have served as a force in his life even earlier, possibly weeks or days or hours after his birth. Schoenholt comes from a line of coffee men. His business, <a href="http://www.americanantiquarian.org/Exhibitions/Food/coffee.htm">Gillies Coffee Co.</a>, champions itself as “America’s Oldest Coffee Merchant.” There’s a fair chance that declaration is correct. Established in Manhattan in 1840 at 232 Washington Street by Wright Gillies (the Schoenholts took it over in the early 1900s), Gillies used the most advanced industry technique available at the time: a horse-powered roaster stationed in the middle of its courtyard.</p>

                <p>Schoenholt has sculpted himself into an informal scholar on the history of coffee—in part because it’s his business, and in part because he seems to be almost equally interested in the history of everything else. Schoenholt is like a balloon taut with a never-ending reservoir of water. Prick a hole in it and the balloon will release more than a drop; it will gush. Prick Schoenholt with a question and he’ll reward you with a treatise.<br><br>Ask Schoenholt how coffee has evolved as an industry in New York City, and he’ll begin with a story that’s rooted on the other side of the world. Some of the first accounts of coffee come from 16th-century Muslim clerics, who would drink it to stay awake at night so they could chant their prayers. (Although really, he interjects, coffee likely existed as a beverage 500 years earlier, since petrified roasted coffee beans have been found in Israel. And, to be fair, in years also predating the clerics, coffee berries were mashed and mixed with animal fats and snacked on like trail mix by hunters up the Arabian Peninsula.) Known for its ability to endow people with energy, coffee was co-opted by physicians, who discovered that it also served as an excellent headache remedy.<br><br>Coffee crept throughout the Arab world—permeating Persia, Egypt, Syria and Turkey—making its way to Europe by the 17th century. When it was finally brought to America by the Dutch in the mid-1600s, it was primarily sold through apothecaries and taverns.<br><br>In a nascent society where safe drinking water was rare, coffee was valued similarly to beer, says Schoenholt, since beer is fermented and coffee boiled and therefore much safer than well water. “You could drink it safely, it might help your headache, it gave you energy,” he says. “A lot of things contributed to its success.”<br><br>Although the first American coffeehouse, The Kings Arms, opened on Broadway and Cedar Street in 1696, it wasn’t until 1790 that the wholesale coffee roasting industry emerged. When it did, New York’s position as a great port city helped shape the coffee industry. Like many other commodities of the time, coffee stayed close to the water. The industry clung to rivers’ edges. By the time Gillies opened, the Hudson River side, where water was calmer, hosted coffee warehouses and factories. On the east side of Manhattan, where the river was choppier and where it was harder for ships to come in, wholesale coffee dominated the district now known as South Street Seaport. Like a tablespoon of water poured onto a coffee filter, the industry seeped outward from its point of origin. Coffee came to New York and slowly spread to Philadelphia and Boston and eventually all the way to Seattle.</p>

                <p>Coffee’s place in the market shifted as inventors concocted means to keep it fresher longer, such as paper bags. Without aid, the roasted beans only stayed fresh for a few days. Paper bags granted them a full two weeks of freshness. But it was John Arbuckle, Jr.’s invention—a sugar slurry that was used to coat coffee, making its berries look like brown jelly beans—that succeeded in keeping coffee freshest the longest (a whole two weeks). The innovation made Arbuckle so much money that he founded the first national brand of coffee, Ariosa, in 1864. Seated at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge on the Brooklyn side, his Grand Green Coffee Warehousing contained in the largest coffee-roasting machine in the U.S. The goliath could spit out 5,000 pounds of coffee a batch, cycling through every 15 to 20 minutes. Running all day and all night, it singlehandedly roasted enough coffee to sate a nation.<br><br>“What happened to the New York coffee industry is what happens to all industries in all cities that decide they don’t want to be industrial anymore,” says Schoenholt. “Somehow, along the way, New York decided that it wanted to be a white collar town.” This shift started at the docks, which teemed not only with coffee roasters but with grain merchants, warehousemen and leather workers. “This city was a dirty, grimy, wonderful port city,” he adds, “a smelly, terrific, noisy, angry, dangerous place. A place that you can only dream about when you go to South Street Seaport and hear the sea shanties and have a lobster and get the Disney version of the New York waterfront.”</p>

                <p>After World War II, new middle and upper middle classes emerged, and the docks turned distasteful—“They were not places where you take your kids,” says Schoenholt. At the same time, real estate in the city rose in value, pushing unions to jack up wage demands. The final hit came with the 1964 New York World’s Fair. In need of a major route to funnel people from America’s Heartland through Manhattan to Flushing Meadows, the city decided to claim Water Street. The city declared eminent domain and the coffee roasters trudged away. Compensated with only one tenth to one fiftieth the market value of their buildings, says Schoenholt, most roasters went out of business. Those that remained moved to the outer boroughs.<br><br>Gillies held out in Manhattan a while longer, glued to the east bank of the city until the early ’90s. Now in South Slope, Brooklyn, at 150 19 Street, the 173-year-old business is small but strong.</p>
